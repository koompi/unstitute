# Unstitute

Purposely spelled as "Un Institute"

An experimental education model favoring a self-directed learning approach. 

Student orientation is achieved through first formulating a personal vision and strategic plan with an objective to develop clarity of long term educational goals.  

Coursework is based on the premise that through exploration and development of a general idea of where a student wants to go, a more detailed plan can be developed on how to reach an intended destination.

Learners are encourage to develop their own educational coursework based upon personal interests, while flexibility is considered for changing or shifting interests, or as extenuating circumstances arise.
